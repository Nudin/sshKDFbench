Test how how long a certain number of rounds of OpenSSH's KDF takes.

You private key should never be stored unencrypted on disc. It should therefore
be encrypted with a password. Since human usable passwords are weak a key
derivation function (KDF) should be used. KDFs are basically hash functions
designed to be slow. The KDF should be used several times to make it unfeasible
to brute force the password. The more rounds the harder is it to crack, but the
longer you self need to wait every time you decrypt the key.

This script tests how long a given number of rounds take. Use the highest
setting that is still feasible for you to use.
